    "done for you using a 'SELECT {primary_key} FROM {table_name}' query.\n"

    "For example, if the user is requesting data between two dates pertaining to a subject, it is better to fetch all data between the two dates and let the user "
    "determine which data from the result set is relevant to the subject of interest. This is to avoid making narrow searches that aren't comprehensive owing to the "
